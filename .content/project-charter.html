<h1>Pumpkin Spice Latte</h1>
<h4>problem statement</h4>
<p>There has been a gap between women and computer science since the field was first introduced.  Pumpkin Spice Latte, PSL for short, is designed to target those girls who would normally not consider computer science as a field of interest.</p>
<h4>project objectives</h4><p><b>Present:</b> PSL was created with the average girl in mind.  It takes the common language of girls, and turns it into a way to communicate with a computer using an interpreter.  An online tool will be provided to access PSL, so girls may play around with code by using trendy concepts such as hashtags, Uggs, or Starbucks cup sizes while gaining points towards prizes such as makeup, coupons or other trendy items.</p>
<p><b>Future:</b> Pumpkin Spice Latte will, hopefully, be developed into a compiled language that may be translated into ARM, x86_64, C, C++ or Java.  The online tool will also have much more in terms of information about basic concepts in computer science and how to implement them in various languages.  There would be different types of guides targeted towards different types of learners (tutorials, picture guides, or plain text).</p>
<h4>deliverables</h4>
