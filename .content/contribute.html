<h4>report issues</h4>
<p>issues or <b>bugs</b> are problems with the output of the code that you write in psl, like the output doesn't match your logic.
<br/>
<br/>an example of a bug that was found:
<span style="background-color: #2c2c2c; font: 15px Courier; color: #eb9c36;">
<br/>short ana = 0
<br/>
<br/>so #ana < 10:
<br/>  #ana = #ana + 1
<br/>totes
<br/>
<br/>can.i.just.say.something: #ana
</span>
<br/>
<br/>logically, this should output: <b>10</b>
<br/>but, the output read: <b>2</b>
<br/>
<br/>this was due to an error in the comparison during evaluation, and was fixed.
<br/>
<br/>in order for a <b>bug</b> to be fixed, it needs to be reported, which can be done by visiting psl's <b>git</b> repository where the source is housed.
