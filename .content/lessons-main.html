<h1>learn psl</h1>
<p>this section is all about learning the fundamentals of <i>Pumpkin Spice Latte</i> as a programming language. you'll learn how to declare variables, print to the screen, and take input from the users.</p>
<p>with the data you collect, you'll learn how to do some simple math with it and print your results to the screen. these <b>lessons</b> will teach you some of the fundamentals behind computer science, as well as its proper terminology.</p>
<p>my hope is that, by psl v1.0, you'll be able to accomplish the same amount of functionality as most other lanuages. right now, i have the most basic of basic operations implemented.</p>
<p>i, also, have some plans to write a compiler for the language, in parallel with the interpreter, to make the language easier to install and use</p>
<h2>ENJOY!</h2>
