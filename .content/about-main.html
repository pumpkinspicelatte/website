<h1>Pumpkin Spice Latte</h1>
<h2>okay, so, what is this website?</h2>
<p>as you already know, psl's are the most delicious fall beverages known to mankind, but they've inspired something inside of us to create a programming language based on the concept behind a euphoria-inducing fall dream. this website acts as a portal to learn <i>Pumpkin Spice Latte</i>, the programming language. not only will you learn the language, you'll learn some of the basic concepts behind a nerdy field called computer science.</p><br/>
<h2>je te pr√©sente psl</h2>
<p>with the growing demand for girls in computer science, we deemed that it was necessary to create a language that basics could relate to. we've adopted the common language of <i>girls</i> to a programming language that gives them an easy transition into the world of coding. our goal is to bring in girls that would not necessarily consider computer science as a field of interest, and, hopefully, increase the female presence in this field.</p>
<h2>sidenote</h2>
<p>though this language was written with girls in mind, other people are more than welcome to use and contribute to this programming language!</p>
